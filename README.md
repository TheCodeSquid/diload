# diload

diload (pronounced "dye-load") is a simple node.js tool I made to help with adding data to static sites
in a simple, manageable way.

## How Does It Work?

Directories are used to group JSON files or other directories together.
When bundled, these groups will be represented by simple JSON objects,
with the file names becoming the keys.
